		=== INTRODUCTION ===

	What am I doing?
I am implementing a spectral method for simulation small, spherical particles sedimenting in a fluid.
I compare this method to other methods employed by others, by looking at convergence, differences in flow etc.
I also compare macroscopic phenomena, in relation to how the other methods behave.

	What am I not doing?
I limit the point2grid interp to epsilon hats and delta blobs.
I limit the grid2point interp to some simple built-in function.
I limit the time step to Euler forward.
I limit the primitive periodic cell to a cubic NxNxN grid.
I do not go much into comparing the evolution of the point clouds.

		=== THEORY ===
	
	What does the reader need to know before we get started?
Stoke's equation
Point particles
delta function smearing
Discretization

	...and maybe also
More on the fourier transform
Some notes on the periodicity

		=== METHOD ===

	How exactly do I go about this?
I do it in four steps.
I use Matlab.

		=== RESULTS ===
	Stuff on the following format:
What did I do,
what did I get.

		=== DISCUSSION ===
I discuss the results - maybe this is more integrated with the results section?

		=== CONCLUSIONS ===
Wise words.

		=== REFERENCES ===
Bla bla bla.

		=== APPENDIX ===
	What did the reader not neccessarily need to know from me?
Some fourier theory, scaling.
Something on moments of delta functions.
Some notes on the periodicity assumption.
